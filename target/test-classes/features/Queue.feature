Feature: Feature for Queue Validation
  I want to use this template for my feature file

 

  Scenario Outline: User enters Queue Page
    Given User logged in homepage for Queue
    When  User select Queue from dropdown
    Then  User should be directed to Queue page
    And   "Queue" is displayed on Queue page
    And   User checks for Topics covered in Queue page
    Given User is in Queue Page
    When  User clicks for options "<options>" in Queue page
    Then  User lands in Topics "<Topics>" in Queue Page
    And   Checks for links available in Queue page
    When  User clicks on Try Here button in Queue page
    Then  User navigates to a page having TryEditor and Run Button in Queue
    When  User gets valid input from "<sheetname>" and <Row> to run a tryEditor code in Queue
    Then  User is presented with run output in Queue
    Given User is in Queue Page
    When  User clicks for options "<options>" in Queue page
    And   User clicks on link "<link>" in the Queue page
    When  User clicks on Try Here button in Queue page
    Then  User navigates to a page having TryEditor and Run Button in Queue
    When  User gets valid input from "<sheetname>" and <Row> to run a tryEditor code in Queue
    Then  User is presented with run output in Queue
    
    Examples:
  |options                               | Topics                                |sheetname | Row | link                                    |
  |Implementation of Queue in Python     | Implementation of Queue in Python     | inputs   | 1   | Implementation using collections.deque  |

  |Queue Operations                      | Queue Operations                      | inputs   | 1   | Implementation using array              |
    
   Scenario Outline: TryEditor verification in each page for invalid code
      
    Given User logged in homepage for Queue 
    When  User select Queue from dropdown
    Then  User should be directed to Queue page
    When  User clicks for options "<options>" in Queue page
    Then  User lands in Topics "<Topics>" in Queue Page
    And   Checks for links available in Queue page
    When  User clicks on Try Here button in Queue page
    Then  User navigates to a page having TryEditor and Run Button in Queue
    When  User gets invalid input from "<sheet>" and <Rownumber> to run a tryEditor code in Queue
    Then  User gets error message in Queue
    Given User is in Queue Page
    When  User clicks for options "<options>" in Queue page
    And   User clicks on link "<link>" in the Queue page
    When  User clicks on Try Here button in Queue page
    Then  User navigates to a page having TryEditor and Run Button in Queue
    When  User gets invalid input from "<sheet>" and <Rownumber> to run a tryEditor code in Queue
    Then  User gets error message in Queue
    Given User is in Queue Page
    When  User clicks for options "<options>" in Queue page
    And   clicks on Practice questions in Queue page
    Then  User navigates to Practice questions Page in Queue
    
  Examples:
  |options                               | Topics                                |sheet  | Rownumber| link                                  |
